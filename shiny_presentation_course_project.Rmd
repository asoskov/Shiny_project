# Shiny Application and Reproducible Pitch

## Some info about the data

I've chosen the dataset about diamond's prices and due to my application anyone can try to predict a price of a diamond with a input value of carats.

## The third slide

Honestly, I don't know what I can add before showing the links to my application and gihub repository so you can switch it right now.
